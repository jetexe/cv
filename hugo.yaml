          Vehicle Insurance conveyor.

          The vehicle Insurance conveyor is a system that collects information about vehicles,
          drivers, and owners from several sources and calculates insurance policy prices.

          My contribution:
          Designed the platform and developed a large part of the system.

          Highlights:
          Fully gRPC network between the services of the conveyor. Each service of the system can
          get any part of data from the integration level, which allows to build a very flexible product.

          Also created a list of services that helps improve whole company performance under high RPS load.
